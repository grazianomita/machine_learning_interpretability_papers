# Interpretable Machine learning
This is a public collection of papers related to interpretable machine learning (ML). Someone might think that ML interpretability is a recent field, however, throughout the history of machine learning, researchers have always proposed methods that are interpretable or can "explain things in human-understandable terms"! Unfortunately,  making an exhaustive list of works is complicated because many papers, especially the oldest ones, had not the word "interpretable/interpretability/explainability" in the title. The works reported here represent a small subset of what has been done in the field (and I personally read).

**You can find additional references in my PhD Thesis. You could give it a read if you are interested in the topic:**

## Introduction to Model Interpretability
These are some of the more recent references to read if you are approaching the field of model interpretability and you want to have a general view of the field. "Explaining things" is not a machine learning specific concept: there is tons of research in philosphy, psychology, sociology, of how people generate/evaluate explanations. Restricting our attention to machine learning, interpreting a model might mean understanding how the model works interally; it might also translate into explaining why a model answers in a certain way! These are examples of different "types" of explanations. The way we explain things is often model and application specific! Last but not least, we should also be able to evaluate and compare the quality of explanations.

## Association Rule Mining
Association Rule Mining methods come from the Data Mining community. The so called class association rules are extracted from the data through algorithms like Apriori, FP-growth. A subset of them is selected with simple ranking or selection heuristics, and used to classify new records. Rules are usually expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF) and are considered to be interpretable by nature. Few and compact rules are preferred.

## Incremental Rule Learning
Incremental methods allow to continuously update the model when new data arrives. For rule-based models (I will also consider decision trees here) updates corresponds to changes in the set of rules (add/remove/update a rule). Research in incremental interpretable methods had a huge impact in 90's, but interest in the field has grown again recently especially in the database community.

Incremental supervised methods assume that labels become available together with the input (or at least with a delay that is tolerable). When labels are scarse or not available at all, unsupervised or semisupervised incremental methods are the only solution. To the best of my knowledge, there are no rule-based methods that can work in these settings.


## Case-Based Interpretable Models
Case-based models like KNN (k-nearest neighbors) classify new records based on previously seen records. More specifically, every new input is compared with previously seen records (usually its neighbors) and classified according to a measure of distance. For case-based models, interpretability translates into similarity: a given input is assigned to class C if it is similar to other samples that were previously classified in the same way. I am not going to report here all the well-known work on case-based methods. Instead, I will focus on recent papers that I think are innovative and interesting to read.

## Post-hoc interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks are the black-box model "par excellence". Thus, it is not surprising that a significant part of the publications on model interpretability is neural network specific. Unfortunately, I have not spent enough time on this specific sub-field, but I hope these short list of papers might be useful.

## Time-series classification/forecasting with neural networks + attention
Attention mechanisms have recently gained popularity in training neural networks. They have shown their potential for machine translations, overcoming most of the limitations of standard recurrent neural networks, and allowing for more interpretable models. Recently, there have been several attempts to extend the attention mechanism to (multi-variate) time-series.

## Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations

Representation Learning consists of learning representations of the data that make model classification/prediction easier.  In particular, there has been a growing interest for learning interpretable representations that can be understood to humans, more specifically disentangled representations. A representation is said to be disentangled when "a change in one dimension corresponds to a change in one factor of variation, while being relatively invariant to changes in other factors". When we use generative models to learn disentangled representations, the goal is to learn a latent space such that latent dimensions (or a subset of them) encode independent factors of variations (that are supposed to be involved in the generation of the data). This should be done in an unsupervised way, that is without explicitly knowing which are the generative factors of variations at training time.

## Weakly-supervised Learning of Disentangled Representations

A recent result from Locatello et al. 2019, showed that unsupervised disentanglement learning is fundamentally impossible. That is why recent research is focusing on weakly-supervised methods where we do not need to explicitly provide the generative factors at training time, but we still can provide some kind of supervision. An example of weak supervision can for example be the class label. Alternatively, we could also group input records together if we think they share some generative factors. Here, I report the most recent works on the field.
